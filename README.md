# MineSweeper

Minesweeper is a game where mines are hidden in various random locations in a two-dimensional minefield. The player has to figure out where all the mines are without exploding a mine. They do this by repeatedly uncovering locations, and guessing mine locations, until they uncover all of the non-mine locations (win) or they explode a mine (lose). This is more than a game of chance, because when a non-mine square is uncovered it displays the number of mines adjacent to that square. The player can use that information to figure out where the mines are (or at least narrow down their locations).
